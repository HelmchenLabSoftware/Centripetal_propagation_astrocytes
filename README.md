## Centripetal propagation in astrocytes

Custom code to compute **centripetal propagation** patterns from **astrocytic calcium** recordings using pixel-wise **correlation functions**.

The code in this repository will be made available during the publication process.

The content of the repository will be the following:

- A small example astrocytic calcium recording movie
- A standalone script in Matlab (script) and Python 3 (Jupyter notebook) each
- The script will generate a 2D map of delays of each pixel with respect to the global mean activity

A link to the related manuscript will be included once a preprint has been deposited on bioRxiv. Any requests and comments should be directed to [Peter Rupprecht](mailto:p.t.r.rupprecht+astrocytes@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]).
