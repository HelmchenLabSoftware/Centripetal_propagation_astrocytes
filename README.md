## Centripetal propagation in astrocytes

Custom code to compute **centripetal propagation** patterns from **astrocytic calcium** recordings using pixel-wise **correlation functions**.

The code in this repository will be made available during the publication process.

The content of the repository will be the following:

- A small example astrocytic calcium recording movie
- A standalone script for both Matlab (script) and Python 3 (Jupyter notebook)
- The script will use a raw or denoised calcium movie (tif stack) to generate a 2D map of delays of each pixel with respect to the global mean activity

The related manuscript draft has been uploaded to bioRxiv as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v1). Any requests and comments should be directed to [Peter Rupprecht](mailto:p.t.r.rupprecht+astrocytes@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]).
